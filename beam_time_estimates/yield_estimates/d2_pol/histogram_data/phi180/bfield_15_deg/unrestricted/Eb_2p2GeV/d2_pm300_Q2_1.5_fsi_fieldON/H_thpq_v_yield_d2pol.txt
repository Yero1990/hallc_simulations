# 1D Histogram Bin Extraction 
#                   
# histogram parameters:  
# title      : In-Plane Angle, $\theta_{pq}$ (vertex)   
# xbins      : 40   
# xlabel     :  in-plane angle, $\theta_{pq}$ [deg]   
# xbin_width : 0.250 
# ylabel     :  Counts   
#                   
# header definitions:
# xb:         x-axis bin number 
# x0:         x-axis central bin value 
# xlow:       x-axis low-edge bin value 
# xup:        x-axis up-edge bin value 
# ycont:      bin content (y-axis) 
# ycont_err:  bin content error (y-axis) 
#
