directory contains analyzed histograms for the optimized
kinematics

optimizations:
1: adjust HMS momentum to center delta at ~0% (only necessary for pm=200,300 settings)
   -> this adjustment shift the recoil angles (theta_rq)
      more forwards (smaller FSI) and also slightly improves
      our statistics
