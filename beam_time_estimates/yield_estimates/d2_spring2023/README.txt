xsec_corrected/
------------------
This directory contains data files / plots of the
simulated JML Paris FSI yields after cross-section corrections, defined
as:  R = commissioning_dataXsec / JML_Paris_FSI_Xsec from the commissioning
experiment. This is to account for the differences observed between the
measureed cross-sections and JML Paris FSI model during commisioning.
The corrected yileds are a more realistic simulated representation of the
measured yields during commissioning.
