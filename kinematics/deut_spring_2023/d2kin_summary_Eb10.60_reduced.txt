# Carlos' Comments:
# 
# Above is a small sample I selected of all the deuteron kinematics at fixed Q2 = 4.25 (for both low and high pmiss settings)
#
# I thought it would be a good idea to select a low pmiss setting, just as it was done in the commissioning part, but am not sure exactly which kinematic
# or whether it should be a a lower Q2.  I think there may be more data at lower Q2 (less beam time to accumulate statistics for this setting)
#
# For the high pmiss setting, I kept the xbj = 1.35 and Q2 = 4.25, just as in the original proposal
# Note the th_nq ~ 40 deg, as expected from these kinematic settings.
# In terms of selecting the high p-miss setting, I guess it depends on the time. How much time can we realistically get ?
# Based on the commissioning data, just for 580 / 750 MeV/c setting we had very wide coverage, so I would pick pm = 700, 800 and 900 MeV/c. Let me know what you think.
#
# Probably we should try to match the low pmiss SHMS angle/momentum with that of the high pmiss setting just so we don't have to move the SHMS, as cross sections are sensitive to e- angle
# (we can check with simulation where will the low p-miss data land in the focal plane, i.e., how far will the shifts be from the center of focal plane in erms of momentum and angle acceptance?
#
# I think we should probably also take a few hydrogen elsatic settings that covers the entire momentum range of the deuteron settings (I guess once we know how much time we will have)
# We can set up meeting some time this week (tomorrow) or next week to discuss this, if there is time.
