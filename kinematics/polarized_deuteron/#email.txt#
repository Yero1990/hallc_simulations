If you wanted to then find the nitrogen contribution instead (for figuring out dilution factor),
then for the density you would use rho_N = (m_N/(m_N+3*m_D))*(rho_ND3)) instead.
 
Technically, we would want the rho_N=(rho_N/rho_ND3)*rho_ND3, but since rho=mass/volume and
the volume is the same (since weâ€™re using the molecular volume, not the particle volume) that
would cancel out of the top and bottom leaving us with just the masses.
 
Then for the helium contribution, you can use the density of liquid helium (0.1412 g/cm^3)
and the inverse of the packing fraction for that background.
