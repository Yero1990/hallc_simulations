In the theory report for your proposal, they say that
-----------------------
Since the proposed experiment only measures scattered electron and the knocked-out proton, 
the “missing” neutron will be reconstructed from momentum conservation, 
any collision-induced photon radiation would not be measured and it could alter 
both the direction (θq in Fig. 6) and the value of exchanged virtual photon 
momentum q between the electron and the deuterium. 
Since the central neutron recoil angles are defined relative to direction of momentum 
transferred from the scattered electron to the deuterium target (q), a careful simulation 
and control of such collision-induced radiation will be needed and important for the 
proposed study of FSI.
-----------------------

I naively imagine the effect of such collision-induced radiation is small enough, 
but is it correct? How much will be the effect?



Response:

Yes, we have included radiative effects in SIMC for the incoming electron, scattered electron and scatter proton using the prescription described in
 Phys.Rev.C 64 (2001), 054610 . This is a standard prescription used for all Hall C coincidence experiments.
We apply the correction for each of the (theta_nq, Pmiss)  bins. For the published d(e,e'p) data of
Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 262501 (2020) the correction factor (radiative to non-radiative yield ratio) was between 1 and 2 for
missing momenta up to 1.8 GeV/c corresponding to neutron central recoil angles 35 deg and 45 deg (see  Fig. 11 of Supplementary Materials of Ref. [14] )



See Fig. 11 of Supplementary Materials of Ref. Yero et al. (2020) https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.262501
which shows the ratio of radiative to non-radiative effects for missing momenta up to 1.2 GeV for recoil angle ~35, 45 deg.
