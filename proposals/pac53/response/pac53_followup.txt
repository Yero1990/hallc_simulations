In the theory report for your proposal, they say that
-----------------------
Since the proposed experiment only measures scattered electron and the knocked-out proton, 
the “missing” neutron will be reconstructed from momentum conservation, 
any collision-induced photon radiation would not be measured and it could alter 
both the direction (θq in Fig. 6) and the value of exchanged virtual photon 
momentum q between the electron and the deuterium. 
Since the central neutron recoil angles are defined relative to direction of momentum 
transferred from the scattered electron to the deuterium target (q), a careful simulation 
and control of such collision-induced radiation will be needed and important for the 
proposed study of FSI.
-----------------------

I naively imagine the effect of such collision-induced radiation is small enough, 
but is it correct? How much will be the effect?
