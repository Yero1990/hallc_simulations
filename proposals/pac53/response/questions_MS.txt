Questions for Misak:

1. What is meant by 'angular condition' ? 
Does it specifically refers to the appearance
of L=1 (P-wave) state in the deuteron ?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. In the momentum distribution plot from Frank Vera's thesis (Fig. 4.8),
Can you verify the following:

(i) [dashed blue] momentum distribution calculated within VNA,
using a non-relativistic deuteron w.f.

(ii) [solid orange] momentum distribution calculated using a
relativistic deuteron w.f. that has both the 'pn' and non-nucleonic components

(iii) Does a calculation exist for where the momentum distribution is calculated
using a relativistic deuteron w.f. which ONLY includes the 'pn' component ? And would
this calculation be expected to be somewhere in the middle between non-relativistic and
(relativistic with non-nucleonic) ?

Is this plot integrated over all internal angles: cos (theta) =  (alpha - 1) Ek / k, ?



---------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. for the angle defined as: cos (theta) =  (alpha - 1) Ek / k,

(i) What is the interpretation of this angle ? Is is the internal angle
of the proton (while still inside the deuteron) relative to the direction of
the incident virtual photon, q ?

How can we experimentally find Ek, k ? Is it just the energy
and relative momentum of the bound neutron inside the deuteron, in which
case, to experimentally calculate it, should we just is the missing momentum of neutron
while selecting minimal FSI, (Pmiss ~ intrernal nucleon momentum k assuming PWIA)


(ii) alpha is the light cone momentum fraction of the proton which I have defined in my code as:

alpha = 2 - alpha_n  (since alpha + alpha_n = 2)

Can you verify that the definition of alpha_n is given by:

alpha_n = (En - PmPar)/ (MD/2.),

where 
En -> Energy of recoil neutron En = (sqrt(MN^2 + Pmiss^2)
PmPar -> parallel component of missing momentum relative to q : PmPar = Pmiss * cos(theta_nq)
MD -> mass of deuteron


---------------------------------------------------------------------------



4. from the article "A new structure in the deuteron" Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 112502, Fig.1, the
light-cone momentum distribution vs. cos(theta), show a significant difference between
calcualtion with only the 'pn' component compared to non-nucleonic components at 1 GeV, compared to 800 MeV
momenta.  Our proposal focuses on Pm=800 MeV/c, but the acceptance extends up to 940 MeV (with smaller stats)
Can calculations for for Pm=900 MeV, be generated as well ?

for our deuteron FSI proposal, I believe that provided the cos(theta) is close or equal to zero,
then we can actually detect a signature of non-nucleonic component, given that from the
momentum distribution vs. cos(theta), the largest difference between the calcualtion with only
the 'pn' component (dashed) and that including non-nucleonic effects (solid) happens when cos(theta) = 0

Can we  bin the data in bins of cos(theta) to select a specific
angle where cos(theta)=0, or is this not necessary?  Additional binning
would probably significantly reduce statistics even more for our proposal.
