Comments and questions from the first reader:

(1) Please describe the difference between your previous Hall C experiment [14] and the
proposed experiment. I understand that you will repeat the experiment with the same
kinematics but with a wider angular coverage of theta_nq =30-80 deg to investigate the
effect of FSI. What else are different? How much statistical improvement do you expect
in the theta_nq =30-50 region? Please plot, in Fig.14, the data points of the previous
experiment [14] at 35 and 45 for various p_m.


Answer:









(2) Since this experiment is an extension of the previous one with the same setup, there
seems to be no major problem in the feasibility and the systematic errors. Are there any
concerns in using a higher beam current (80 muA) than before (45-60 muA), as mentioned
in the TAC report? Are the target and DAQ systems the same as before? Please show us
your possible concerns and/or expected improvement, if any, in the performance of the
apparatus, DAQ, or the analysis, compared to the previous experiment.


Answer:



















(3) It is not very clear how well you will be able to understand and/or control the FSI by
using the new data from this experiment.

In the proposal, you wrote “If it is due to the wave function then this experiment for
the first time will establish the existence of non-nucleonic components in the deuteron.”,
but how and in which case can you establish the non-nucleonic components?

Based on Ref. [15], you hope to observe “angular anisotropy” as evidence for non-
nucleonic components. FIG. 1 of Ref. [15] shows an anisotropic distribution falling
down at forward and backward angles above 800 MeV/c. Although the definition of
“angle” is different, I am afraid that it could be difficult to distinguish between the
angular distribution from the FSI and the angular anisotropy due to exotics. Could you
roughly draw in Fig.14 an expected angular distribution (in theta_nq) for the anisotropy
due to exotics? (Although, of course, it will be done after the relativistic PWIA
calculation by Sargsian is finished.) Will you need a wider coverage of theta_q and/or
better statistics to confirm the angular anisotropy in future?
(If possible, please send me Ref.[1] because I cannot access it from my university.
In addition, if possible, could you give an intuitive explanation on why angular
anisotropy appears from non-nucleonic components at a relativistic regime? --It was
hard for me to understand it from Ref.[15].)













Additional Question from first  reader (Hiro)

I still have a little concern. How does the relativistic theoretical calculation 
depend on the NN interaction model?

From Fig.3 in your proposal, you assume that the CD-Bonn model perfectly 
describes nucleonic processes (although the calculations are non-relativistic.)
In my understanding, since the CD-Bonn as well as other NN models are adjusted 
so as to reproduce the NN scattering data up to E(lab)=350 MeV (namely, p(CM)~380 MeV/c), 
it is quite natural that PWIA calculations with these models cannot reproduce 
the NN short-range phenomenon above p_r~400 MeV/c. Actually, above p_r~400 MeV/c, 
the PWIA cross sections with CD-Bonn, AV18, Paris begin to separate from each other. 
It is surprising that the CD-Bonn PWIA seems to agree with the data up to p_r~700 MeV/c.
Although CD-Bonn is a sophisticated meson exchange model and thus it could be better 
than the others, but it may not guarantee that the CD-Bonn can be safely used as a reference 
of the nucleonic PWIA around and above p_r~700 MeV/c, apart from the nonrelativistic problem.
I completely agree that observation of the anisotropy as in Fig.1 of Ref.15 is a clear evidence 
for non-nucleonic component, but I am afraid that theoretical ambiguity in the calculated 
(nucleonic) momentum distribution could make the situation complicated.
