#This datafile contains exp. redXsec and ratio to (JML Paris, MS CD-Bonn, MS AV18) PWIA, from Hall C Deuteron Experiment: E12-10-003
#Units: pm_avg [GeV/c] :: redXsec [fm^3], pm = 680 +/- 20 MeV/c
# the line with the zeros only have the averages of ratios of previous duplicate thnq entries (just for making the ratio plots)
