--> unpolarized d(e,e'p) Pm>800 MeV/c, with SoLID detector (Eb = 22 GeV)
    (make estimates of cross-sections at different locations of phi)

    * ask for help to get started to prepare a few slides to present at 22 GeV workshop
      to show proof of principle of how such an experiment would be realizable using
      the SoLID detector at 22 GeV

    * perhaps I can start with simulatons using Hall C spectrometer at 22 GeV


(discuss briefly polarized deuteron)
